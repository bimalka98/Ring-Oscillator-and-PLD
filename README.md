# Ring Oscillator and PLD

*This repository contains all the source files related to design and simulation of a Ring Oscillator and a Programmable Logic Device(PLD) using LTSpice XVIII simulator.*

## Project Outcomes

1. [Project Report](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bimalka98/Ring-Oscillator-and-PLD/blob/main/Group37_EN2110Assignment/Report%20Group-37-180079X-180437U-180631J.pdf)
2. [Source Files](Group37_EN2110Assignment)



## Assignment Description

We were supposed to submit the following files for this assignment.

1. **A report**
- Index numbers and group number as the cover page.
- 2nd page with contributions of each member
- Waveform, results, discussion (problems faced and how to overcome them , mathematical calculations if any)

2. **Simulation files indicating the question number**

|Circuit|Description|
|:----|:----|
|Circuit 1: Parasitic effect in Timing analysis (evaluated to 15 marks)|Design a 3 stage (3 inverters) ring oscillator. Find the correlation of the parasitic effect in the oscillation period.|
|Circuit 2: PLD ( evaluated to 35 marks)|Part 1: Design a programable logic block to configure it as a 'NAND' or a 'NOR' gate using a single selection bit. (10 marks)<br> Part 2: Design a single switch matrix using six pass transistors. (10 marks)<br> Part 3: Design a PLD that can be used to design any 3 input combinational circuit. (15 marks)<br>|

## Simulator: LTSpice 

* Plot formatting: Tools -> Control Panel -> Waveforms
* Other necessary features of the LTSpice is explained in the report itself.
